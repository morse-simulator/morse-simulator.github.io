It focuses on realistic simulation of small to large environments, indoor or outdoor, with one to over a dozen of autonomous robots.\r\n\r\nMORSE provides out of the box a large set of standard sensors (cameras, laser scanner, GPS, odometry,...), actuators (speed controllers, high-level waypoints controllers, generic joint controllers) as well as several robotic platforms (ATRV, generic 4 wheel vehicle, PR2,...). New ones can easily be added.\r\n\r\nBesides generic socket-based APIs, MORSE fully integrates with standard robotic middlewares, including ROS and YARP.\r\n\r\n[Learn more!](http://www.openrobots.org/morse/doc/latest/what_is_morse.html)\r\n\r\n### Get the code\r\n\r\nFork us on GitHub: [github.com/morse-simulator/morse](http://github.com/morse-simulator/morse)\r\n\r\n...or download the [lastest stable release](ftp://ftp.openrobots.org/pub/openrobots/morse/morse-1.0.1.tar.bz2) (`morse-1.0.1.tar.bz2` - 93MB - 02-Apr-2013).\r\n\r\n#### Installation\r\n\r\nCheck the [installation notes](http://www.openrobots.org/morse/doc/stable/user/installation.html).\r\n\r\n> MORSE is mainly supported on Linux and MacOSX.
